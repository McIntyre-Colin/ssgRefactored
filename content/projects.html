                    The objective of the Capstone was to design and model a Human Powered Vehicle capable of competing on a collegiate level. That meant designing for speed, manuverability, comfort, and safety.
                    This entailed a collaborative effort in choosing every component on the HPV from aerostructures to drive train.

                    I was responisble for designing the Rollover Protection System (RPS) and performing finite element analysis on it to ensure that the design was safe.

                   The goal of this project was to use a combination of Matlab and CoppeliaSim to complete a "Pick and place" task. This was accomplished by creating and modifying functions in the 
                   Matlab robotics toolkit to control the joints of the robotic manipulator as well as the image detection and suction cup. Two solutions were created, one with inverse kinematics, the other with forward kinematics.
                   The video shows the solution with inverse kinematics as it was the more challanging and intersting of the two.
